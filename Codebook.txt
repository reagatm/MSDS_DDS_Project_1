beersbreweriesimputedmice # for capturing the imputed data during computation while using mice and VIM packages
beersbrewsimputed # for capturing the imputed data, which is the clean dataset and has all null values imputed, will be used in model
beersbreweriesimputedIPAAle # includes the IPAOrAle classifier feature added to the imputed dataset
beersbreweriesimputedIPAAleKNN # contains only the "IPA" or "Ale" beers in the dataset, used as input dataset for running the k-NN model & Naive Bayes model
